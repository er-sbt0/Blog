# Code Review: Issues Found

Sorted by importance/severity.

---

## 1. Monolithic 1258-line `store/app.ts` — God File

**Severity: Critical**

`src/store/app.ts` contains every async thunk (30+), the Redux slice reducers, and utility functions for local + cloud operations in a single file. This violates SRP massively and makes the file nearly unmaintainable. Thunks were partially split into `seriesThunks` and `userThunks` but hundreds of lines remain in the root file.

---

## 2. O(n) Linear Scans in Reducers — No Entity Adapter

**Severity: High**

Every `extraReducers` case in `src/store/app.ts` calls `state.documents.find(...)` for lookups. With many documents this is O(n) on every dispatch. The idiomatic RTK solution is `createEntityAdapter()`, which gives O(1) lookup by id and eliminates the duplication of the find/upsert pattern repeated ~20 times.

---

## 3. Non-idiomatic RTK: Manual `.type` String Comparison

**Severity: High**

In `src/components/EditDocument/hooks/useCloudSave.ts`:

```ts
if (revisionResponse.type === actions.createCloudRevision.fulfilled.type) {
```

The RTK-idiomatic pattern is `dispatch(action).unwrap()` — which throws on rejection and returns the payload on success. Manual `.type` comparison is fragile (brittle strings), loses type safety, and is an anti-pattern explicitly called out in RTK docs. The same pattern appears in `useDocumentLoader.ts` and `syncLocalToCloud` in `store/app.ts`.

---

## 4. `createdAt: string | Date` Union Type Inconsistency

**Severity: High**

`src/types.ts` defines `EditorDocument.createdAt` and `updatedAt` as `string | Date`. This leaks everywhere, forcing runtime type checks (`instanceof Date ? .toISOString() : ...`) scattered across `loadLocalDocuments`, sort comparators, and sync operations. Dates should be normalized to `string` (ISO 8601) at the persistence boundary — the type should be `string` throughout.

---

## 5. Direct Mutation of IDB-Fetched Object in `forkLocalDocument`

**Severity: High**

In `src/store/app.ts` inside `forkLocalDocument`:

```ts
document.head = revision.id;
document.updatedAt = revision.createdAt;
document.data = revision.data;
return thunkAPI.fulfillWithValue(document);
```

The IndexedDB object is mutated in place before being passed as a payload. This violates immutability principles and can silently corrupt the IDB cache object since IndexedDB may return a live-ish reference.

---

## 6. Global Mutable Module-Level Singleton `saveRegistry`

**Severity: Medium**

`src/components/EditDocument/saveRegistry.ts` stores a single `saveCallback` in module-level mutable state. This breaks if multiple editor instances exist, leaks across tests, is incompatible with SSR, and entirely bypasses React's model. The proper pattern is React Context or passing the callback explicitly via props.

---

## 7. `isClient` SSR Guard + `dynamic({ ssr: false })` Double Anti-Pattern

**Severity: Medium**

`src/components/EditDocument/index.tsx` uses both `dynamic(() => import('./Editor'), { ssr: false })` AND a `useState(false)` + `useEffect(() => setIsClient(true))` guard. The dynamic import already handles the SSR boundary — the `isClient` pattern adds an extra render cycle needlessly and is a known Next.js anti-pattern when `dynamic` with `ssr: false` is already present.

---

## 8. Empty Reducer Body Used as Action Signal

**Severity: Medium**

In `src/store/app.ts`:

```ts
triggerAutosaveBeforeNavigation: (state, action) => {
  // This is intentionally empty as we'll handle this action in middleware
}
```

A reducer is a state-transition function. Having one that does nothing to state — used purely as a "signal" — is an anti-pattern. Standalone action creators should be created with `createAction()` outside the slice for this purpose.

---

## 9. `errorInfo: any` in Error Boundary

**Severity: Medium**

In `src/components/EditDocument/index.tsx`:

```ts
componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: any)
```

`React.ErrorInfo` is the correct type. Using `any` defeats TypeScript and violates the project's own ESLint rule `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`.

---

## 10. No Error Recovery in `EditorErrorBoundary`

**Severity: Medium**

`src/components/EditDocument/index.tsx` has no key-based reset mechanism or `getDerivedStateFromProps` for recovery. Once the error boundary triggers, it permanently shows the error screen — navigating to a different document won't recover it since `hasError` is never reset to `false`.

---

## 11. Derived Data Computed in Hook Chains, Not Memoized Selectors

**Severity: Medium**

`src/components/PostsList/hooks/usePostsData.ts` chains `usePostsFiltering → usePostsTimeFilter → usePostsSearch → usePostsGrouping` — four hooks each re-computing derived arrays on every render. This logic belongs in `createSelector` (Reselect/RTK) memoized selectors, not hook chains that recompute on any store dispatch.

---

## 12. Misleading `payloadCreator` Parameter Name in Thunks

**Severity: Low**

Thunks like `createLocalDocument`, `updateCloudDocument`, `forkLocalDocument` use `payloadCreator` as the action argument parameter name. In RTK, `payloadCreator` is the name of the *async function callback itself*, not the argument passed to it — this causes confusion for anyone familiar with RTK conventions.

---

## 13. `"use client"` Directive on Pure Logic Hook Files

**Severity: Low**

`src/components/EditDocument/hooks/useAutoSave.ts` and `useCloudSave.ts` carry `"use client"` at the top. Custom hooks don't need this directive — it is meant for component files. Since these hooks call no Server Component APIs, the directive is incorrect and misleading.

---

## 14. `as unknown as SerializedEditorState` Type Escape

**Severity: Low**

In `src/components/EditDocument/hooks/useDocumentLoader.ts`:

```ts
} as unknown as SerializedEditorState,
```

This double-cast is used because the inline hardcoded editor state literal doesn't satisfy the type. The fix is to use the already-defined `EMPTY_EDITOR_STATE` constant from `src/types.ts` (or define a named constant for "welcome" content), rather than casting through `unknown`.
