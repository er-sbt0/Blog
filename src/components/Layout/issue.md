# Layout Component Issues

## 8. `navigationItems` in `useMemo` with empty deps — should be a module constant

**File:** `SideBar.tsx:92-98`

```tsx
const navigationItems = useMemo(
  () => [
    { text: "Home", icon: <Home />, path: "/" },
    ...
  ],
  [],
);
```

A `useMemo` with empty deps `[]` is equivalent to a module-level constant but slower (React still calls the factory once and stores the result). JSX elements created here are also re-created each time the component mounts. This should be a `const` at module scope.

## 9. Complement conditions instead of ternary

**File:** `SideBar.tsx:193-204`

```tsx
{user && activeDocuments.length > 0 && (
  <ActivePostsSection ... />
)}
{(!user || activeDocuments.length === 0) && (
  <Box sx={{ flex: "1 1 auto", minHeight: 0 }} />
)}
```

These two blocks are exact logical complements. They should be a single ternary `{condition ? <ActivePostsSection /> : <Box />}`. The current pattern is non-idiomatic and requires reading both conditions mentally to understand they're mutually exclusive.

## 10. Unused ref in `DocumentInfoDrawerArrow`

**File:** `DocumentInfoDrawerArrow.tsx:21`

```tsx
const arrowRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
```

`arrowRef` is attached to `<Paper ref={arrowRef}>` but its `.current` value is never read anywhere in the component. It's dead code.

---

## 11. `useKeyboardShortcuts` returns a value no caller uses

**File:** `SideBar/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts:44`, `SideBar.tsx:57`

The hook returns `{ shortcutHint: "Ctrl+B" }` — a hardcoded string. The only caller destructures nothing:

```tsx
useKeyboardShortcuts({ onToggleSidebar: toggleSidebar, enabled: true });
```

The return value is dead. Either remove it from the hook's return, or use it in `SidebarHeader` to fix issue #2 above (single source of truth for the shortcut string).

---

## 12. Redundant `maxWidth` and identical responsive breakpoints in `AppLayout`

**File:** `AppLayout.tsx:42-56`

```tsx
<Container
  maxWidth={false}         // disables MUI's responsive cap
  sx={{
    maxWidth: "100%",      // redundant — maxWidth={false} already does this
    px: {
      xs: 1,
      sm: 1,
      md: 1,              // all three breakpoints are identical — just write px: 1
    },
  }}
>
```

Both issues are minor but indicate copy-paste without cleanup.

---

## 13. Partial manual type instead of `Theme` in `PostContextMenu`

**File:** `SideBar/PostContextMenu.tsx:28-31`

```ts
const borderBottomSx = {
  borderBottom: (theme: { palette: { mode: string } }) => ...
};
```

The theme parameter is typed as a hand-rolled partial object instead of the MUI `Theme` type. This bypasses type safety and is non-idiomatic.
